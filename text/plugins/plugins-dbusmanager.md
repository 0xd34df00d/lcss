shortdescr: Enables LeechCraft to use D-Bus

---

Provides some API for LeechCraft via D-Bus.

Support for MPRIS (both [client-](/plugins-xtazy) and [server-side](/plugins-lmp))
or FreeDesktop-style Desktop Notifications (again, both [client-](/plugins-sysnotify)
and [server-side](/plugins-laughty)) does not depend on this plugin.
