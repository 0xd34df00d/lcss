Azoth Modnok detects and renders LaTeX formulae directly in
chat windows.

If a protocol supports rich text messages, Modnok may also replace
formulae in outgoing messages with the corresponding images, so that
your chatmates would see the nice rendered formulae instead of raw LaTeX
code.

Unfortunately, Modnok works only on Unix-like systems with LaTeX
installed, so support for Windows will hardly arrive anytime soon.
