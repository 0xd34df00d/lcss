TPI (short for Task Progress Indicator) shows the progress of various
running tasks that have not been finished yet, be it BitTorrent downloads,
XMPP file transfers or anything else.

It adds a quark to panels like [SB2](/plugins-sb2) with a progress bar
for each ongoing task, and more detailed list is displayed on hover.
