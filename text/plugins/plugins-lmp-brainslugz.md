LMP BrainSlugz is the discography completeness checker.

BrainSlugz uses other plugins like [MusicZombie](/plugins-musiczombie)
to fetch up-to-date discographies of artists in your music collection,
and shows what albums, EPs and other types of releases are lacking. It
also fetches the tracks information for the missing releases, so you can
easily preview them by clicking a single button.
