Lemon is LeechCraft Network Monitor. It provides a quark for panels like
[SB2](/plugins-sb2) and traffic graphs.

The quark displays an indicator per active network interface with a bar
for upload/download activity:

`{ "name": "lemon_indicators_focused.png", "align": "inline", "title": "" , "thumb" : "medium" }`{.img}\

A graph with RX/TX speeds is available by clicking on the corresponding
indicator:
