LeechCraft milestone 0.4.90 "Stay the Course" is released!

As we move towards the 0.5.0 release, our releases get more tested and
with less new features. Sorry us, that will change back again after the
0.5.0 release :)

So, some new hot features for this release:

- Nicer tray notifier in
  [AdvancedNotifications](/plugins-advancednotifications).
- Support for [metacontacts](/plugins-azoth-metacontacts) in the
  [Azoth](/plugins-azoth) IM.
- Support for new XEPs to [Azoth Xoox](/plugins-azoth-xoox):
  [XEP-0027](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0027.html) (OpenPGP) and
  [XEP-0144](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0144.html) Roster
  Item Exchange.
- [Azoth](/plugins-azoth) core now understands encrypted chat sessions
  (like with OpenPGP), sharing contacts, and such, to make the new
  things from the previous item usable.
- [Azoth Acetamide](/plugins-azoth-acetamide) now supports autojoin,
  bookmarks and autoidentify.
- `/say` and `/msg` commands in [Acetamide](/plugins-azoth-acetamide).
- Support for configuring channels in [Azoth
  Acetamide](/plugins-azoth-acetamide).
- [Azoth Xoox](/plugins-azoth-xoox) can now be used to update own
  vCards as well.
- Support marking items as "Important" in
  [Aggregator](/plugins-aggregator).
- Lots of optimizations and fixes in [Poshuku
  CleanWeb](/plugins-poshuku-cleanweb): particularly, Flash can be
  blocked again.
- Optimized and fixed quite a few things in [Aggregator
  BodyFetch](/plugins-aggregator-bodyfetch).
- Fixed chat window styling in [Azoth](/plugins-azoth): more Adium
  styles are now handled correctly.

Of course, this is a brief list of changes. As always, you can read more
detailed overviews of the new features in the corresponding digests:
[\#10](/devel-digest-10), [\#11](/devel-digest-11) and
[\#12](/devel-digest-12).

Packages for Ubuntu Lucid, Maverick, Natty and Oneiric would hopefully
be available in a few hours, as well as ebuilds in the official Gentoo
portage. Windows build is also coming.

Stay tuned!
