We've finally got an account on PayPal, so [donating](/donate) us is now
a little bit easier. Previously only Yandex.Money service was available
making it hard for people from countries other than Russia and some
other CIS members to donate.\

So, please send us a couple of bucks if you find this project useful.
Though, to be honest, contributions on forms of code, translations and
UI are even more welcome!
