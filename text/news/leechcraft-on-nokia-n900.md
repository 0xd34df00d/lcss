Thanks to guys with nicknames Disabler and smith, LeechCraft is proved
to run on Nokia N900. Disabler made it run on N900 with Ubuntu
installed, while smith worked with native Maemo installation.

Of course, the interface is not adapted to finger-based manipulations,
stylus is required to work with LeechCraft, but this proof-of-concept
shows that LeechCraft can run there at all, so after some UI adaptation
we would have another supported platform :)

If you want to try LeechCraft on N900 with Ubuntu, you can install [Qt
4.7.1](/files/qt-everywhere-opensource-src_4.7.1-1_armel.deb),
[QXmpp](/files/qxmpp_0.2.92-git20110213_armel.deb) and
[LeechCraft](/files/leechcraft_20110213-1_armel.deb) from the deb
packages. Icons ans shortcuts for Hildon [are also
available](/files/leechcraft-n900-icons.zip) â€” that archive should be
unpacked into `/usr`{type="bash"}.

And, well, some screenshots now:
