Poshuku allows one to install scripts that make on-the-fly changes to
web page contents via the Poshuku FatApe plugin. These scripts could be
used for adding new features to web pages (for example, embedding price
comparisons within shopping sites), fixing rendering bugs, combining
data from multiple webpages, and numerous other purposes.\
\
This chapter documents how userscripts could be installed and how they
could be edited and managed.

Installing userscripts
----------------------

\
\
We will consider the [Userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org) site
here. Installation process is similar for other sites.\
\
Let's navigate to the site and pick a userscript for installation, for
example, [this one](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/86674). Click
the *Install* button:\
\
\[img\_assist|url=images/fatape-install1a.png|title=|align=inline|link=1|width=750\]\
\
After that, FatApe's dialog will pop up with some information about the
script (the domains where it is enabled or explicitly disabled):\
\
\[img\_assist|url=images/fatape-install2.png|title=|align=inline|link=1|width=750\]\
\
You can view the script sources to ensure it doesn't do anything
malicious, or you can just click *Install* to install it. That's
basically it, the script is installed now. If you have any pages open
that should be working with the just installed script, just reload them.

Managing userscripts
--------------------

\
\
Open FatApe settings. There you can either disable/enable the installed
userscripts, remove them or edit them. Editing requires entering the
path to a text editor at the bottom.
