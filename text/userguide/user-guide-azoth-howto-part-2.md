If you managed to get through the issues of constructing your set of
modules and decided to bring up the client, you'll be greeted with the
welcome screen, and the application window itself. A notification about
hundreds of user packages in Lackman also appears (here and below all
beforementioned modules are assumed to be active). We'll get back to
them alter.\
\
You could note the rubber band with the word *Azoth* on top of the
contact list (also called as *roster*, by default placed on the right
part of the window). Dragging this rubber band (1 on pic. 1) widgets can
be moved and attached to different parts of the window. I prefer keeping
the roster on the left part to keep most of the information in the same
part of the screen, as long messages don't get over the half of the
screen. I also keep the sb2 panel at the bottom. Pressing the
configuration button on sb2 (2 on pic. 1) will bring up settings mode
with the element (3 on pic. 1) for moving panel between different window
sides. Other quarks will also get a red minus sign (4 on pic. 1) which
can be used to hide the quarks. A hidden quark can be brought back by
pressing a green plus sign (5 on pic. 1), appearing near the
configuration button.\

\
Let's get to our trip into LeechCraft world and add a few IM accounts to
start chatting! Press the first button in the roster (1 on pic. 2), then
"Add accountâ€¦" (2 on pic. 2). It's worth noting that native IRC
implementation is in the beginning of the protocol list, while native
XMPP is in the end. It is recommended to use native implementations as
they have the widest features set.\

\
After adding the accounts we can change the global status by the button
above the roster (1 on pic. 3) or for each account separately by
right-clicking the account in the roster (2 on pic. 3). Then we enter
the password. After coming online I immediately turn off displaying
offline contacts by pressing the corresponding button on top of the
roster (3 on pic. 3).\

\
After that we click the LC button (1 on pic. 4) to get to the settings
(2 on pic. 4) of the Azoth (3 on pic. 4) module. There are a few
settings worth noting on the *Behavior* page (1 on pic. 5). The *Roster*
tab (2 on pic. 5) has an option to activate contacts by double click (3
on pic. 5). If you feel like using multiuser chats, you may also
activate automatic contact list mode switching (4 on pic. 5) and hiding
conferences participants in common contact list (5 on pic. 5). Please
note the buttons to apply (6 on pic. 5) the settings (don't forget to
press it!) or cancel (7 on pic. 5) changes, or to go back (8 on pic.
5).\

\
If your account has bookmarked multiuser chats with autojoin turned on,
you can toggle automatic chat tabs opening (3 on pic. 6) in tabs (2 on
pic. 6) behavior (1 on pic. 6) options group. Bookmarked conferences can
be joined manually via the account (4 on pic. 6) context menu (5 on pic.
6). After joining conferences are added as roster entries (6 on pic. 6),
and their participants all reside in a single contact list group. You
can use the line edit above the roster (7 on pic. 6) to search for an
entry in the contact list. Roster display mode can be toggled between
full view and conference view by the rightest button above the roster (8
on pic. 6), which also has a configurable shortcut.\

\
Meanwhile one can go to the *Appearance* page (1 on pic. 7), then to the
*Chat windows* tab to disable formatted messages (3 on pic. 7) to avoid
some Pidgin-related issues, for example. Minimal message edit height (4
on pic. 7) can also be configured there (I prefer two lines). Moreover,
here resides the font size option (5 on pic. 7). The fonts themselves
can be configured (3 on pic. 8) on the corresponding tab (2 on pic. 8)
of the *Appearance* tab again (1 on pic. 8).\

\
Next, we can configure the height of a single roster entry (3 on pic. 9)
in *Contact list* tab (2 on pic. 9) of *Appearance* page (1 on pic. 9).
On the same page (1 on pic. 10) we can go to *Chat windows* tab (2 on
pic. 10) and configure chat styles (3 on pic. 10). Changing a complex
Adium theme can take some time if you have a dozen of opened chat
windows, so it's recommended to close (almost all of) them before
changing the styles. The various iconsets can be also changes on the
same page.\

\
You can change the global LeechCraft color scheme in the settings (1 on
pic. 11) of the LeechCraft core (2 on pic. 11), particularly on the
*Appearance* page (1 on pic. 12), choosing the proper color theme (2 on
pic. 12). There you can also set the default system iconset or choose
another icon theme (3 on pic. 12).\

`{ "name": "im12.png", "align": "inline", "title": "Picture 12", "thumb": "medium" }`{.img}\
\
As the final part of our preliminary configuration we can set the
default status texts (2 on pic. 13) in status settings (1 on pic. 13).
We can also create custom predefined statuses (2 on pic. 13) and
entering arbitrary text on the fly via the *Custom* action (4 on pic.
13) of the status change button above the roster (5 on pic. 13).
Similarly, custom statuses can also be defined on the per-account basis
via the accounts context menu.\
