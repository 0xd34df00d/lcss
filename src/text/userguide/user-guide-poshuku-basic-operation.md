Opening Poshuku
---------------

\
\
There are several ways to open Poshuku tab:

-   hit *Ctrl+T*;
-   click the Plus button in the tabbar;
-   right-click the tabbar, enter the *New tab menu* and select
    *Poshuku*.

\
\
Of course, clicking a hyperlink would also result in Poshuku tab being
opened.

Accessing functions
-------------------

\
\
Only back, forward and reload/stop buttons are presented to the user, as
well as the addressbar, of course. Most other functions are hidden in
various context menus.\
\
One of the context menus pops up when one right-clicks on somewhere on a
web page. The menu contents depend on the object being clicked:
different menus would pop ups for an image, a hyperlink, etc.\
\
Another menu is hidden in LeechCraft menu. To access its functions, open
the main LeechCraft menu and navigate to the *Poshuku* submenu. There
are functions that may be otherwise unavailable, like full-length web
page screenshotter. Poshuku plugins may also add different actions
there. For example, Poshuku OnlineBookmarks plugin adds actions for
synchronizing bookmarks to that menu.

### History and bookmarks

\
\
To open History or Bookmarks, hit *Ctrl+H* or *Ctrl+B* respectively
while staying on a Poshuku tab. After that, one can grab the splitter
between history/bookmarks and the web page with the left mouse button
and drag it to adjust the size. Dragging right to the edge of the screen
effectively closes history/bookmarks tabs. Of course, dragging the
splitter back from the edge of the screen opens the tabs back again.

Working with tabs
-----------------

\
\
By default Poshuku is configured to open new tabs in background. To open
a link in a new tab, hold *Ctrl* while clicking the link. To reverse the
behavior (i.e., to open a link in foreground when by default they are
opened in background), hold *Ctrl+Shift* while clicking on a link. To
force opening in current tab, right-click the link and select *Open
here*.\
\
If you've accidentally closed a tab, don't worry even it happened 50
tabs ago! Poshuku keeps the list of recently closed tabs (in fact, an
infinite list). You can access it by right-clicking anywhere on a page
and going to the *Recently closed* submenu which is typically located at
the very bottom.
