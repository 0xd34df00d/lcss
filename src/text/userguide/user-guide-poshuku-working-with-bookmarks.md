Poshuku allows to assign different tags to different bookmarks, thus
helping you to organize them in a natural way, rather then restricting
each bookmark to a single folder.

Adding bookmarks
----------------

\
\
There are several ways to add a bookmark:\
\

-   hit *Ctrl+D* on the web page you want to add to bookmarks;
-   click the *Add to bookmarks* button in the address bar (see the
    image);
-   select the *Add to bookmarks* action in the web page context menu.

\
\
\[img\_assist|url=images/bookmarks-addbookmark-a.png|title=Add to
bookmarks button in the address bar|align=inline|link=1|width=600\]\
\
Whatever way to add you choose, you'd be greeted with the dialog that
allows you to edit the title and tags of your bookmark before adding
it:\
\
\[img\_assist|url=images/bookmarks-addbookmark-dialog.png|title=|align=inline|link=1|width=750\]\
\
Enter the ';'-separated list of tags or right-click the corresponding
line edit and select the already existing tags. Tags may contain
spaces.\
\
After you've added the bookmark, the star will become filled. Generally,
the star is filled whenever you visit an already-bookmarked page.
Clicking the star removes the bookmark. Please note that Poshuku won't
warn you regarding the bookmark removal.

Working with saved bookmarks
----------------------------

\
\
One of the ways to open the list of bookmarks is to hit *Ctrl+B*. The
list of bookmarks will appear, grouped by tags. If a bookmark has
several different tags, it would be in each group for each tag it has.
To open a saved bookmark, just click on it. A new tab will open with the
bookmarked page.

### Editing

\
\
You can edit both name/tags of the bookmark and its URL. Either can be
done by right-clicking the bookmark in the bookmarks list and choosing
the corresponding action.

### Removing

\
\
A bookmark can be removed by either right-clicking the bookmark and
choosing the *Remove* action, or by selecting it and pressing the
*Delete* key on the keyboard. A bookmark can also be removed by pressing
on the star while being on the corresponding bookmarked page. Please
note that Poshuku won't warn you regarding the bookmark removal.

### Searching bookmarks

\
\
You can search and filter bookmarks either by string contained in the
title or by tags.\
\
To search by title, just enter the corresponding string in the search
field in the *Bookmarks* tab. The search string can either be a plain
substring, a mask or a regular expression. The mode is switched by the
corresponding combobox near the search field. Filtering can also be
toggled to be case sensitive or case insensitive.\
\
To search by tags, either enter the ';'-separated list of tags manually
and select the *Tags* search type, or just right-click the search field
and select some of the tags.\
\
You can open all of the bookmarks shown at once by clicking *Open in
tabs* button at the bottom of the *Bookmarks* tab.
