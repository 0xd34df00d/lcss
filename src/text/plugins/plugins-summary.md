tasks like leeching or seeding torrents, IM file transfers or music
transcoding progress with context-dependent actions and views. It also
can collect status information from other plugins like unread channels.\

Summary also allows to perform searches via the installed plugins like
[SeekThru](/plugins-seekthru), [HistoryHolder](/plugins-historyholder)
or [vGrabber](/plugins-vgrabber).\
