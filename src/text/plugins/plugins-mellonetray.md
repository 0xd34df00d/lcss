shortdescr: so that third-party applications can embed their tray icons into LeechCraft

---

Mellonetray provides a system tray quark for [SB2](/plugins-sb2), so
that third-party applications can embed their tray icons into
LeechCraft.\
\
This is an X11-only plugin. Moreover, it's only active in desktop mode,
and since only one tray can be active at a time, make sure you don't
have other tray applications if you want to use this one.
