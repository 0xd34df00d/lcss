Poshuku WebEngine provides the WebEngine-based rendering backend,
which is essentially an integrated Chromium instance.

The WebEngine backend has batter support for newest web standards
than the [WebKitView](/plugins-poshuku-webkitview), and it also has
multiprocess architecture, providing a more reponsive UI at the cost
of higher resources usage.
