Azoth Vader provides supports for the MRIM protocol used in the Mail.Ru
Agent IM service.

Vader uses its own MRIM implementation, partially
based on publically available (and outdated) official specs and partially
reverse-engineered. The following protocol features are supported:

- Extended statuses.
- Attention requests (alarms).
- Publishing current tune and fetching others' tune.
- Message delivery receipts.
- Mailbox notifications.
- Opening mailbox without login.
- Authorization management.
- Grouping contacts.
