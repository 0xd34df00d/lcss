Poshuku SpeedDial provides the Speed Dial start page for the Poshuku
browser.\
\
SpeedDial shows a separate list for most visited sites, so if you visit,
say, separate stackoverflow.com pages quite often, the site will be
shown in the list as well, though each page isn't visited often enough
to be shown in the pages list.

Features
--------

\
\

-   Two separate lists for most visited pages and most visited sites.
-   Manual mode, when only a list of predefined URLs is shown.
