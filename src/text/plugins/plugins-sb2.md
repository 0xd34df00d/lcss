SB2 is the next generation side panel for LeechCraft.\
\
It allows one to open and navigate between tabs (highlighting active and
opened tabs), it also provides tray and quick launch areas, LeechCraft
menu, and it also hosts widgets from other plugins called quarks.\
\
Quarks can be placed in arbitrary order and configured on a per-window
basis.\
\
The following quarks are available, except those bundled with SB2:

-   [GMail Notifier](/plugins-gmailnotifier) for displaying emails in
    a mailbox.
-   [Krigstask](/plugins-krigstask) for a taskbar and desktop pager.
-   [Launchy](/plugins-launchy) third-party application launcher.
-   [Lemon](/plugins-lemon) for network interfaces monitoring.
-   [Mellonetray](/plugins-mellonetray) for system tray.
-   [TPI](/plugins-tpi) for tracking ongoing tasks.

\
\
Other quarks may be installed via [LackMan](/plugins-lackman).
