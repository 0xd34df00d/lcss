SB2 is the side panel for LeechCraft, extensible via special widgets
called plasmoids.

SB2 comes with quarks allowing one to open and navigate between tabs
(highlighting active and opened tabs), provides tray and quick launch
areas, LeechCraft menu, and it also hosts quarks from other plugins.

The panels can be configured on a per-window basis.

The following quarks are available, except those bundled with SB2:

- [GMail Notifier](/plugins-gmailnotifier) for displaying emails in
  a mailbox.
- [Krigstask](/plugins-krigstask) for a taskbar and desktop pager.
- [Launchy](/plugins-launchy) third-party application launcher.
- [Lemon](/plugins-lemon) for network interfaces monitoring.
- [Mellonetray](/plugins-mellonetray) for system tray.
- [TPI](/plugins-tpi) for tracking ongoing tasks.

Other quarks may be installed via [LackMan](/plugins-lackman).
