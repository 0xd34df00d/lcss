Poshuku is a full-featured web browser supporting both WebKit and WebEngine
as the rendering backends.

Features
--------

-   Poshuku is **WebKit**-based thus supporting all major modern
    **web-standards**.
-   Infinite undo of page closes.
-   Integration with other plugins. For example,
    [Aggregator](/plugins-aggregator) uses Poshuku to show items' texts,
    and [SeekThru](/plugins-seekthru) shows search results with Poshuku.
-   Support for international domain names.
-   Saving forms data (via additional plugins as storage backends).
-   Support for **autodiscovery**-links on external entities. This way
    links to **news feeds** and **OpenSearch** descriptions are
    automatically found and suggested with

-   **Tagging** bookmarks and support for the common LeechCraft
    tags base.

    for data storage.
-   Easy lookup of selected words in installed search engines, for
    example, via [SeekThru](/plugins-seekthru).

    filters](/concepts-data-filters) concept.

-   **Adjustable notifications** about page load events.
-   **Cookies manager** to edit and delete cookies.
