Poshuku WebKitView provides the WebKit-based rendering backend.

The WebKit backend is a single-process one with less strain on the
RAM, but consequently providing less responsive browsing experience,
and also lagging a bit behind with the newest web standards support,
as opposed to the multiprocess [WebEngineView](/plugins-poshuku-webengineview).
