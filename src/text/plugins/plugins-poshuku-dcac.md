parentPage: plugins-poshuku
---

Color inversion, temperature shift and brightness reduction for Poshuku
to reduce eye strain. It works on any site without any custom CSS.

DC/AC also supports a somewhat smart mode where colors are inverted only
if average brightness of the web page is bigger than some given
threshold.
