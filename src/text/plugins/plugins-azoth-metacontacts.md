Azoth Metacontacts provides support for metacontacts in LeechCraft.

Azoth Metacontacts provides a dummy account _Metacontacts_ where all
the metacontacts are stored. Physical contacts are represented as
resources of these dummy ones.

Azoth Metacontacts is protocol- and account-agnostic. Contacts from
different accounts belonging to different protocols can be joined into
a single metacontact.
