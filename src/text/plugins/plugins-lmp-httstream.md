LMP HttStream adds HTTP streaming capabilities to the LMP player.

HttStream encodes the currently playing audio into Ogg Vorbis and
streams it to the clients connected (if any). HttStream supports
multiple different servers on different addresses and ports with
configurable encoding quality.

Features
--------

- Configurable streaming quality for different addresses.
- Automatic starting of the audio playback on first client connect.
- Automatic stopping of recoding when there are no clients connected.
