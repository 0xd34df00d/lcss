shortdescr: provides support for metacontacts in LeechCraft

---

Azoth Metacontacts provides support for metacontacts in LeechCraft.\
\
It adds a dummy protocol and dummy account named Metacontacts where all
the metacontacts go. Concrete contacts are represented as resources of
these dummy contact list entries.\
\
Azoth Metacontacts is protocol- and account-agnostic.
