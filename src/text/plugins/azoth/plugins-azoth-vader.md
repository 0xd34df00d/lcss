Azoth Vader provides supports for the MRIM protocol used in the Mail.Ru
Agent IM service.\
\
Vader is based on an own implementation of the MRIM protocol, partially
based on available (and outdated) official specs and partly
reverse-engineered. The following protocol features are supported:

-   Extended statuses.
-   Attention requests (alarms).
-   Publishing current tune and fetching others' tune.
-   Message delivery receipts.
-   Mailbox notifications.
-   Opening mailbox without login.
-   Authorization management.
-   Grouping contacts.
