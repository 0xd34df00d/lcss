shortdescr: allowing to scrobble to services supporting the Submissions API 1

---

Scroblibre is a scrobbling plugin for modules like [LMP](/plugins-lmp)
allowing to scrobble to services supporting the Submissions API 1.2.\
\
Scroblibre doesn't offer all the features of
[LastFMScrobble](/plugins-lastfmscrobble) and supports only the
scrobbling, while the latter also supports all nice social features of
Last.FM, like similar artists, recommendations or recent releases.
