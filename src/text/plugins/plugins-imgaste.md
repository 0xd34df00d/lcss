Imgaste uploads images from other plugins to image pastebins like
imagebin.ca or dump.bitcheese.net. For example,
[Auscrie](/plugins-auscrie) and [Poshuku](/plugins-poshuku) use it to
upload screenshots and web page shots, respectively.

It is an implementation of the image [data filters](/concepts-data-filters) concept.
