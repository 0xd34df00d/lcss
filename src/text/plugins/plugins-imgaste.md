shortdescr: uploads images from other plugins to image pastebins like imagebin

---

Imgaste uploads images from other plugins to imagebins like
imagebin.ca or dump.bitcheese.net. For example,
[Auscrie](/plugins-auscrie) and [Poshuku](/plugins-poshuku) use it to
upload screenshots and web page shots, respectively.

Imgaste also knows about different imagebins' limits on file size and image
dimensions limits and automatically filters out those that would not accept
a given image.

Imgaste is an implementation of the image [data filters](/concepts-data-filters) concept.
