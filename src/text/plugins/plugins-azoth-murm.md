Azoth Murm provides support for VKontakte messaging via native API
instead of XMPP.\
\
Using native API allows Murm to support various additional features not
available via XMPP API, such as displaying photos in messages (as well
as other media attachments) or fetching more information about users
than is available in VCards provided via XMPP. Moreover, XMPP will be
closed on August 31 this year.\
