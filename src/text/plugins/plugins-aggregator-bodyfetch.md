Aggregator BodyFetch plugin allows to automatically fetch full bodies of
news items and replace the original teasers from RSS feeds with them, so
that it appears like the full news stories were originally there.\
\
Fetching is done according to little scripts called recipes. For this to
work, a script provider like Qrosp should be installed. Please refer to
the guide to [writing
recipes](/development-aggregator-writing-recipes-for-bodyfetch) if you
are interested in writing your own ones.
