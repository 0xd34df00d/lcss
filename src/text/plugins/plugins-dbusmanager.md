shortdescr: Enables LeechCraft to use D-Bus

---

Enables LeechCraft to use D-Bus. Currently, this only means showing
notifications via implementations supporting FreeDesktop's notifications
standard, like KDE 4.4 (or higher), Gnome, XFCE and others.\
\
Currently DBusManager only exists under \*NIX.
