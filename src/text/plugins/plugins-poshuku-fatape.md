FatApe provides support for GreaseMonkey userscripts. These scripts
could be used for adding new features to web pages (for example,
embedding price comparisons within shopping sites), fixing rendering
bugs, combining data from multiple webpages, and numerous other
purposes.\
\
This plugin supports almost whole API of GreaseMonkey and is compatible
with most userscripts present "in the wild".\
\
FatApe usage is documented on the corresponding [user guide
page](/user-guide-poshuku-greasemonkey-userscripts).
