Today LeechCraft 0.3.95 is released. This release designates the
beginning of feature freeze for the 0.4.0 version, which we will talk
about a bit later.

LeechCraft 0.3.95 is available prepackaged, as always, for the following
distros and OS right now:

- Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10, from
  `ppa:0xd34df00d/leechcraft`{type="bash"} PPA repository.
- Gentoo, from the `rion` overlay, the leechcraft-full-0.3.95 package.
- Microsoft Windows: [download from
  SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leechcraft/files/LeechCraft/0.3.95/leechcraft-0.3.95.exe/download).

And, well, now about the 0.4.0 version. We have only three open issues
for the 0.4.0 version, and all of them are feature requests, so
LeechCraft 0.4.0 is expected to be released in the following week or
two. We will have 4 releases inbetween every 3-4 days, each with
bugfixes and maybe a new feature..
