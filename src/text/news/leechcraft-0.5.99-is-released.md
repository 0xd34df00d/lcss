LeechCraft 0.5.99 "Some Kind of Monster" is released today.\
\
This is the last pre-0.6.0 release, and again it incorporates only bug
fixes from the master branch (few this time!). It is released (almost)
on 12th July, the same day that
[pastafarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster)
officially became a religious group here in Russia, which is quite an
important event due to general country clericalization with a strong
bias towards Ortodoxy.\
\
Enough for politics, though, here comes the list of improvements and
fixes:

-   [AN](/plugins-advancednotifications): fixed a typo in a
    user-visible string.
-   AN: updated English and Russian translations.
-   [Azoth](/plugins-azoth): auto-request logs for MUC participants
    as well.
-   Azoth: fixed font zooming in fixed-font MUCs.
-   [Azoth CH](/plugins-azoth-chathistory): don't test the entry type,
    leave that to core.
-   [LMP](/plugins-lmp): fixed a segfault on removable device removal in
    sync widget.
-   [Lemon](/plugins-lemon): added Qwt 6.1 compatibility.
-   [Liznoo](/plugins-liznoo): added Qwt 6.1 compatibility.
-   [Monocle](/plugins-monocle) Mu: link to openjpeg and jbig2dec,
    required by mupdf.
-   [Poshuku CleanWeb](/plugins-poshuku-cleanweb): fixed a
    rare segfault.
