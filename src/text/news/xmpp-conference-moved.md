The jabber.ru server has some stability issues lately, so we've decided
to move our XMPP discussion to the
[leechcraft@conference.leechcraft.org](xmpp:leechcraft@conference.leechcraft.org?join)
conference. Please update your bookmarks!\

Well, not moved, actually. We still will be available at the old
jabber.ru server, but all the discussion (hopefully) will happen on the
leechcraft.org.
