Only four days have passed since our last digest, but nevertheless we
are publishing a new one, since today is... Well, read the next post for
that :)

So, in these four days we managed to do the following:

- Tought [Azoth Xoox](/plugins-azoth-xoox) to handle
  *xmpp:...?message* links.
- Top used status is shown on Fast Change Status button in
  [Azoth](/plugins-azoth) now.
- Optimized timers in LeechCraft, so that it, for example, on my
  machine it causes CPU wake ups 13-17 times per second instead
  of 50-60.
- NPAPI plugins are disabled now in [Poshuku](/plugins-poshuku) since
  that fancy QGraphicsView stuff cannot work with them anymore.
- Fixed segfault when deleting bookmarks in
  [Poshuku](/plugins-poshuku).
- Fixed build of EiskaltDC++ with CMake 2.8.6 and later.
- Added kludges for Qt 4.8 in Poshuku OnlineBookmarks Read It Later.
