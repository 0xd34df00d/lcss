Today LeechCraft 0.5.0 «Saviour Welcome Home» is finally released!\
\
This is a yet another major release of LeechCraft, and we are really
proud to announce it. A lot has changed since the 0.4.0 release more
than a year ago. The most significant change is, of course,
[Azoth](/plugins-azoth) — our brand new multiprotocol modular IM client.
It has plugins for [XMPP](/plugins-azoth-xoox) (quite sophisticated, in
fact) and [IRC](/plugins-azoth-acetamide) protocol in this release, and
support for [Windows Live Messenger](/plugins-azoth-zheet) and [Mail.Ru
Agent](/plugins-azoth-vader) is already in *master*. It also has a bunch
of other plugins, like [Adium styles
support](/plugins-azoth-adiumstyles), antispam module, OTR encryption
support plugin, spellchecker, [TeX formatter](/plugins-azoth-modnok) and
autopaster.\
\
This release also introduces:

-   [Greasemonkey support layer](/plugins-poshuku-fatape) for
    [Poshuku](/plugins-poshuku);
-   module for syncing bookmarks with online bookmarks services like
    Read it Later and Del.icio.us;
-   new, highly configurable notifications framework with the
    [AdvancedNotifications](/plugins-advancednotifications) plugin;
-   a reworked tabs system.

\
\
Also, LeechCraft was optimized a lot. Particularly, heavy RSS operations
like feed updates don't slow down the whole app anymore.\
\
Packages for supported OSes will be ready soon. As always, instructions
for installing are available on the [Download](/download) page. Source
tarball is already available [at
SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leechcraft/files/LeechCraft/0.5.0/leechcraft-0.5.0.tar.xz/download).\
\
Those interested ones may find all the release announcements
corresponding to milestones in the 0.5 series by the
[0.5.x](taxonomy/term/39) tag.\
\
Regarding the future plans, we already have the following in our
*master* branch for the next releases:

-   new tabbed interface and concept — LeechCraft Sidebar;
-   support for MSN/WLM and MRIM protocols in Azoth (and more are
    coming!);
-   better, faster and more compatible Adium styles;
-   mail client;
-   new libvlc-based mediaplayer;
-   infrastructure for syncing settings and data of the whole
    application between different computers;
-   module for network storage management like Yandex.Disk;
-   much, much more.

\
\
We also plan to add support for Google Chrome extensions and move on to
multiprocess WebKit (but that requires Qt 5). An intelligent
application-wide semantic storage is also on its way.
