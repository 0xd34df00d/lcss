We haven't published any digests for some two weeks, and that's because
we've been working very closely on the Advanced Notifications framework,
and we made pretty usable already for the end-user. The corresponding
plugin, AdvancedNotifications, is described in details on [its
page](/plugins-advancednotifications).\
