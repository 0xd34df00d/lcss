We are happy and proud to announce the release of LeechCraft 0.4.0.\
\
This is a huge step forward since the 0.3 release, both in terms of code
and architecture things and in UI, usability and, of course, the
featureset.\
\
Since 0.3.0, we've introduced a better and easier to understand user
interface, several new plugins like Qrosp for scripting support, LackMan
for package management and lots of others smaller plugins. Of course,
there were tons of improvements and bugfixes in already-existing
plugins.\
\
LeechCraft 0.4.0 is already packaged for Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10 and is
available, as always, at `ppa:0xd34df00d/leechcraft`, there are also
ebuilds in rion overlay for Gentoo and PKGBUILDs for Arch Linux. Windows
installer is also
[available](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leechcraft/files/LeechCraft/0.4/leechcraft-0.4.0-1.exe/download).\
\
Please give it a try and report bugs, incosistencies and anything you
find. You can find us at Jabber conference at
leechcraft@conference.jabber.ru and you can also use the
[leechcraft-users@lists.sourceforge.net](https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/leechcraft-users)
maillist.\
\
By the way, it's still hard to develop the application by myself with
rare contributions from other people. So, if you are the one of the
following:

-   UI designers or just people not afraid to run LeechCraft, test it
    and report bugs.
-   Developers for the following features, among others:
    -   Implementation of other protocols in IM client (only XMPP is
        implemented now).
    -   Maintaining EiskaltDC++ for LeechCraft, or writing another DC
        client from scratch.
    -   UI coding.
    -   Support layers for Google Chrome extensions and
        GreaseMonkey scripts.
    -   Media player to replace LMP.
    -   Win32-developers for WIn32-specific tasks and testing.
    -   Any task you find interesting as developer or as user.
-   Maintainers for OpenSUSE, Mandriva, FreeBSD and any other distro.
-   People ready to write documentation, both technical docs and
    user manuals.
