A couple of days ago LeechCraft was added to the official Gentoo
repositories! No need to add third-party overlays to install LeechCraft
now: one could just do `emerge leechcraft-full`{type="bash"} with
official repositories. Of course, up-to-date instructions are available
at our [download](/download) page.\

Of course, this limits what we can do with our ebuilds, but that's even
good â€” thanks to the quality requirements, we've finally fixed few small
but annoying things in LeechCraft and QXmpp. And, of course, we hope
that it would help more users to try LeechCraft out.\

Currently LeechCraft 0.4.85 is available in \~amd64 and \~x86. Live
ebuilds are also available, but masked with `**`.
