A month has passed since previous development digest, and LeechCraft got
some huge improvements.

First of all, the [NetStoreManager](/plugins-netstoremanager) module now
supports synchronization, watching the file system for changes to
automatically upload new or changed files in watched directories. For
now the file system watcher is inotify-only, so this won't work on
platforms other than Linux. And, of course, this is quite an
experimental feature for now â€” use at your own risk.

Then, [Poshuku CleanWeb](/plugins-poshuku-cleanweb) module was optimized
and improved a lot. Particularly, its performance was increased by an
order of magnitude, and it now supports using PCRE as regexp matching
engine, since QRegExps are quite slow. CleanWeb now supports a much
wider subset of AdBlock+ rules, including separator-based rules and
selector-based element hiding.

[Azoth](/plugins-azoth) and [Azoth Xoox](/plugins-azoth-xoox)'s file
transfer capabilities were also improved. Azoth now supports sending
files both by protocol means and via modules like NetStoreManager, all
from a single handy dialog. Also, drag'n'drop support for file sending
was improved significantly. Azoth Xoox now supports setting a SOCKS5
file transfer proxy, and by default it autodetects the one offered by
the Jabber server.

LeechCraft now also supports searching the settings: the pages and
sections containing the search terms are left enabled while the rest is
disabled when searching.

Also, LeechCraft now builds and runs successfully on Mac with clang, and
a new plugin has been added, Pierre, which provides some basic
integration with Mac OS X.
