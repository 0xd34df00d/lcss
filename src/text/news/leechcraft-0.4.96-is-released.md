LeechCraft 0.4.96 "Far Beyond The Days Of Grace" is released!

This is mostly a bugfix release. The only non-bugfix thing is a new
status icon theme *Likey* made by Like-all. Make sure to check it out in
Azoth settings!

Among the fixed bugs are the following ones:

- [\#511](http://dev.leechcraft.org/issues/511): Failure to readd the
  accounts once they are deleted in Poshuku OnlineBookmarks.
- Fixed build of SecMan SecureStorage.
- Fixed handling of media players in Azoth Xtazy that were started
  after LeechCraft had been started.
- [Azoth AdiumStyles](/plugins-azoth-adiumstyles): support styles
  using tags other than *div* for marking message insertion places.
- Fixed handling of */me* in Azoth AdiumStyles.
- Members-moderators are now able to kick participants in [Azoth
  Xoox](/plugins-azoth-xoox).
- Fixed Drag-n-Drop of a contact on itself in [Azoth
  Metacontacts](/plugins-azoth-metacontacts).
- Authorization issues were fixed in [Azoth](/plugins-azoth).
- Self PEP events are also handling in [Azoth
  Xoox](/plugins-azoth-xoox) now.

The tarball is available
[here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/leechcraft/files/LeechCraft/0.5.0/leechcraft-0.4.96.tar.xz/download),
and packages for supported OSes and distros will be available shortly.
