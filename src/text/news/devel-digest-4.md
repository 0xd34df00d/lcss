This week we mostly focused on Azoth and packaging for RPM distros (and
we got included into OpenSUSE as consequence, but that's [another
story](/leechcraft-in-official-opensuse-repos)). So, without any more
intro words, let's get to major changes:\
\

-   Azoth Xoox now supports following XEPs:
    -   [XEP-0184](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0184.html): Message
        Delivery Receipts
    -   [XEP-0221](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0221.html): Data Forms
        Media Element *(thanks generatorglukoff)*.
    -   [XEP-0224](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0224.html): Attention

    Forms has also begun.
-   Azoth supports drawing attention and notifing about attention
    requests from other contacts.
-   Azoth now also supports visual notifications (in the chat window)
    about message receipts.
-   Default altenative nick for MUC conflicts has been added in
    Azoth Xoox.
-   Azoth now supports zooming the chat window by Ctrl+Wheel.

    current MUC are shown.
