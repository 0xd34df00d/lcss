Hi there.

Our maillist previously hosted on SourceForge has moved to [Google
Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/leechcraft) primarily
due to the insane amount of spam on the former.

The maillist is both for users and devs, and we see it as a way to
discuss stuff that requires more concern and time to think about than
what's typically discussed in our XMPP room. It also compensates
somewhat the lack of forums on our site.
