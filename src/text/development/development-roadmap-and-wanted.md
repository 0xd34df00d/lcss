Features we want
----------------

\
\

Jamendo integration in [LMP](/plugins-lmp).
:   We need to support radio streams, obtaining artists info,
    recommendations, album art and similar stuff as does
    [LastFMScrobble](/plugins-lastfmscrobble) for Last.FM.

HAL backend for [Liznoo](/plugins-liznoo).
:   This will be needed for the FreeBSD port of Liznoo, since there is
    no UPower there.

UPower2 backend for Liznoo.
:   This should be pretty simple since UPower2 resembles UPower
    pretty much.
