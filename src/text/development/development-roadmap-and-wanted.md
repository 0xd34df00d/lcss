Features we want
----------------


Jamendo integration in [LMP](/plugins-lmp).
: We need to support radio streams, obtaining artists info,
  recommendations, album art and similar stuff as does
  [LastFMScrobble](/plugins-lastfmscrobble) for Last.FM.

HAL backend for [Liznoo](/plugins-liznoo).
: This will be needed for the FreeBSD port of Liznoo, since there is
  no UPower there.

UPower2 backend for Liznoo.
: This should be pretty simple since UPower2 resembles UPower
  pretty much.
